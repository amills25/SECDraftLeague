# SECDraftLeague

Thirty-nine years ago, a group of avid college basketball fans started a fantasy basketball league following the points scored of their favorite players across the Southeastern Conference around which they lived.

The athletes come and the athletes go, but the league has never waivered.

A lot as changed in the world of technology over the last four decades, so as you can imagine, the league has had to evolve. At the time of inception, there was no internet; box scores were seen in only in newspapers, and player information was only found in preseason magazines. That is, unless you were bold enough to call up a school's athletic department acting like a journalist to ask about what their team had in store for the upcoming season.

But as we enter the third decade of the 21st center, the league is finally entering this millennium. With the ability to log in, set your own lineup, and see your player's points calculated automatically, The Original SEC Draft League can join the ranks of other top tier fantasy sports we all know and love.

It just means more!
